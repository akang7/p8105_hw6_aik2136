### Problem 1

Create a `city_state` variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. Modifiy `victim_race` to have categories white and `non-white`, with `white` as the reference category. Be sure that `victim_age` is numeric.

``` r
homicide_data = 
  read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides/master/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
         solved = ifelse(disposition == "Closed by arrest", 1, 0)) %>%
  filter(!city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL")) %>% 
  mutate(victim_race = ifelse(victim_race != "White", "non-White", "White"), 
         victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "White", "non-White"),
         victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age))
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_integer(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

    ## Warning in evalq(as.numeric(victim_age), <environment>): NAs introduced by
    ## coercion

``` r
balt_model =
  homicide_data %>% 
  filter(city_state == "Baltimore, MD") %>% 
  glm(solved ~ victim_sex + victim_race + victim_age, family = binomial, data = .)

# Obtaining CIs and exponentiating using broom::tidy
balt_model %>% 
  broom::tidy() %>% 
  mutate(OR = exp(estimate),
         OR_Lower_Bound = exp(estimate - (1.96 * std.error)),
         OR_Upper_Bound = exp(estimate + (1.96 * std.error))) %>% 
  filter(term == "victim_racenon-White") %>% 
  select(OR, OR_Lower_Bound, OR_Upper_Bound, p.value) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 4)
```

|      OR|  OR\_Lower\_Bound|  OR\_Upper\_Bound|  p.value|
|-------:|-----------------:|-----------------:|--------:|
|  0.4406|            0.3129|            0.6204|        0|

In Baltimore, the odds of solving a non-White homicide victim's case is 0.44 times the odds of solving a White homicide victim's case (95% CI: 0.31-0.62).
